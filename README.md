## Basic Calculator Project at CODSOFT
# Project Overview
  - This project involves creating a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator will feature an interactive interface with buttons for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users will also have a display screen to show their input and calculation results. This project is a great opportunity to practice combining front-end design with functional JavaScript logic.

# Key Areas of Focus:
  - Interactive Interface: Design a clean, user-friendly interface with numerical and operation buttons, allowing users to easily input data and perform calculations.
  - Display Screen: Create a display area to show real-time user input and calculation results, ensuring an intuitive and responsive experience.
  - CSS Grid System: Leverage CSS grid to neatly organize the calculator buttons, ensuring a well-structured layout that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
  - JavaScript Functionality: Implement the core calculator logic using JavaScript, handling user input and performing calculations through event listeners, operators, and conditionals.

By completing this project, you'll strengthen your understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and learn how to build interactive web applications.
